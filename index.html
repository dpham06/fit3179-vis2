                <p>Welcome to this short visualization talking about our world's climate. Our planet Earth is 4.5
                    billions years old which is a long time especially when you compare it to how long humans have been
                    around, roughly 300,000 years. It is no secret that climate change is taking place at an</p>

                    explore the signs in our environmental data which point toward a shift in climate. Additionally, we
                    will explore some of the consequences that accelerated climate is causing.

                <p>From the chart above, it looks as if the average temperature for the listed countries has not changed
                    for the past 100 years. You would be quite right to think that. In fact, the average global
                    temperature has only moved by slightly more than 1 degree celsius in the last 100 years. This slight
                    change in average temperature would be difficult to deduce from a chart.
                    <br><br>
                    1 degree celsius may not sound like anything to be alarmed about, throughout the course of a single
                    day the temperature fluctuates more than that. Furthermore, 1 degree seems like even less of a worry
                    when you find out Earth's climate naturally experiences periods of warming and cooling. To the first
                    point, the ecosystems and life on Earth have evolved and adapted to the warming and cooling of a day
                    and night cycle. The
                    second point holds a bit more merit and has been used in the past by climate deniers as a
                    counterargument to climate change. However, these periods happen over many years, allowing for slow,
                    gradual adoption and evolution.

                    1 degree of warming in such a short period is enough to warrant sounding the alarms, people and
                    governments all over the world are calling for action. The Paris Agreement, signed by over 190
                    countries in 2016, seeks to limit global warming to below 2 degrees.

                The main cause for climate change is greenhouse gases (GHG). Some GHGs include carbon dioxide
                (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane and nitrous oxide. These gases are naturally present in our atmosphere,
                however their levels are kept relatively stable. GHGs cause the greenhouse gas effect, which traps heat
                and light that would otherwise escape our atmosphere. We depend on a certain amount of CO<sub>2</sub> to
                keep our planet from freezing over. As seen from above, CO<sub>2</sub> is being produced and polluted at
                an increasingly higher rate.
                <br><br>
                <p>CO<sub>2</sub> in particular is the GHG which humans have been polluting the most of, and is the main
                    cause for the increase in global average temperatures. As it is the most polluted GHG, we have come

                    frightening increase in emissions since the early last century. The human species has increased
                    their pollution of CO<sub>2</sub> many magnitudes in a very short period. In the last 20 years, we
                    have roughly doubled how much we output</p>

                <p>The first major consequence of our pollution of the environment is the affect it has on our air
                    quality. As seen from above, air quality is causing deaths in countries all across the world.
                    These deaths alone do not account for the impact reduced air quality is having on all of us as
                    these are deaths directly linked to air quality. According to a report from the University of
                    Chicago, air pollution is taking an average of 2.2 years off the average global life expectancy.

                    Our air quality suffers due to the burning of fossil fuels including

                    which do not release any harmful byproducts are being adopted more and more. These sources
                    include wind, solar, geothermal, hydro, nuclear and others.

                <p>The second and final consequence of climate change we will explore is the number of natural
                    disasters. In particular we are focusing on natural disasters whose rate of occurrence is affected
                    by a change in climate, for example we are not including earthquakes. We can see across the board an
                    increase in the number of natural disasters.

                    Natural disasters have multitudes of consequences which can be summed up by the number of human
                    lives lost and economic damage sustained. As the climate worsens the rate at which these disasters

                    consequence that can happen as a result of natural disasters which we have been witnessing in recent
                    history. A number of food shortages at the same time could lead to mass starvation.

                    The future is not all bleak. The world has woken up to accept that we are the cause of such
                    events. Initiatives all over the world are beginning to tackle our emissions targets.
